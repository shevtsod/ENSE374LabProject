## Compilation
### Eclipse IDE for Java Neon.1
To compile, go to
> File -> New -> Java Project

Name the project, set the `Location` of the project or keep the default, and navigate to the directory of the project in the system explorer.  

Move the `src/ ` folder from this repository and merge it with the `src/ `
directory where you created the project.  

The project files should now be visible in the IDE's `Package Editor`. If not, press `F5` with the `Package Editor` highlighted to refresh the directories.  

Press `Ctrl + F11` to build and run, or `F11` to build and debug.  

You may receive a window to choose how to run the application. Select `Java Application`.  

### IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2
To compile, go to  
> File -> New -> Project

Make sure that `Java` is selected in the list on the left side of the window.
Click `Next`, `Next`, name the project, and `Finish`.  

Move the `src/ ` folder from this repository and merge it with the `src\ `
directory where you created the project.  

Then, open the `Project` tab on the left, and expand the root folder.

Expand `src/com/Main `. In the editor window, click the green play button beside `public class Main`. There, you can choose to either run or debug the program.

### NetBeans IDE 8.2
To compile, go to
> File -> New Project  

Click `Next`, name the project, choose a directory for the project, and click
`Finish`.

Right click on the default package that was created with the same name you
have given the project and `Delete` it.

Move the `src/ ` folder from this repository and merge it with the `src/ `
directory where you created the project. This will automatically update the
project files in the IDE. Press `F6` to run or `Ctrl + F5` to debug.
