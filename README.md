##Compilation
###Eclipse IDE for Java Neon.1
To compile, go to
>File -> Open Projects from File System

Under `Import Source`, press `Directory` and navigate to the folder (lab1, 
lab2, etc.). Click `Finish` to import the files as a project.

Press `Ctrl + F11` to build and run, or `F11` to build and debug.

###IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2
To compile, go to  
>File -> New -> Project

Make sure that `Java` is selected in the list on the left side of the window.
Click `Next`, `Next`, and name the project.  
Then, go to 
>File -> Open

Locate and import the `src` folder. You can now press `Shift + F10` to run or
`Shift + F9` to debug.

###NetBeans IDE 8.2
To compile, go to
>File -> New Project  

Click `Next`, name the project, choose a directory for the project, and click 
`Finish`.

Right click on the default package that was created with the same name you 
have given the project and `Delete` it.

Move the `src\ ` folder from this repository and merge it with the `src\ ` 
directory where you created the project. This will automatically update the 
project files in the IDE. Press `F6` to run or `Ctrl + F5` to debug.

##Details
###Lab 1 - Introduction to Java
Using a text editor, a class `SavingsAccount` was created to hold a bank savings account with monthly compounding interest. It was tested using a class `Bank` and saved as Phase 1. In Phase 2, another implementation of `SavingsAccount` with bi-weekly compounding interest was tested using the same Bank class.

###Lab 2 - Introduction to Java in an IDE (Eclipse)
Using any Java IDE (Eclipse), a class `Employee` was created to hold information for an employee to be tested in a class `Interface`. Instances of `Employee` were placed in an array and populated with data from a file containing randomly generated entries `RandomData.csv` (generated using [generatedata.com](http://www.generatedata.com/))

###Lab 3 - Introduction to Version Control (Git) 
Introduction to version control using command-line `Git`, the Windows shell interface [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/), and `GitHub`. Classes `ListElement` and `LinkedList` were created in Phase 1 to implement a single linked list to become familiar with revision control on `GitHub`. In Phase 2, a branch `doubleLinkedList` was created to modify the linked list and implement a double linked list.

###Lab 4 - Animal Habitat Simulation Project - Requirements & Design
See repository `ENSE374LabProject`.  

Creation of `Software Design Diagram`, `UML Class Diagram`, and coding of class and method stubs for an animal habitat simulation software project.
